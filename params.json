  "body": "### Introduction\r\n“Sea Divided” is a competitive, real time action game where 2 players control an animal and compete for resources. In the current version there is only a sea version so the player plays a fish. Both players gather score by eating prey and then return to their base to score their points. Predators can damage players and will attempt to chase them. The game ends when one player dies or when the round ends. Players can regain health by consuming prey. Players can expend stamina to increase their speed in order to move faster or avoid predators.\r\n\r\n### GAME CONCEPTS\r\n\r\n## Health\r\nHealth is lost to predators and when a player eats an animal that is not part of their foodchain.\r\nHealth can be regained by eating prey that is part of the player's foodchain.\r\n\r\n## Stamina\r\nStamina is regained over time and can be used to increase your speed, it also can be refilled at the base\r\n\r\n## Base\r\nBoth players have a base that only they may enter. While in the base unscored points are scored and stamina recovers.\r\n\r\n## Food Chain\r\nThe game simulates food chain interactions by requiring players to only eat what their animal can eat.\r\nPlayers can regain health from eating things that are part of their foodchain and lose health by eating things that are not. Furthermore the players have to worry about the larger predators that exist as they are not the top of the foodchain.\r\n\r\n## Population Dynamics\r\nThe total number of prey and predators presently on the map is controlled in order to increase the realism of the simulation as well as make the game more entertaining. Players will never run out of fish as they are dynamically spawned off screen and moved on screen in order to maintain the flow of the gameplay.\r\n\r\n## Hints\r\nIf you are being followed by the predator you can often lead them to the opponent in order to trick the predator into chasing the other player.\r\nIf you are having trouble, remember to use your stamina as it comes back relatively quickly.\r\n\r\n### Game made by Karl, Rupal, Anu, Toru and Devon\r\n the original concept for the game was to make an ocean based biome simulator but due to time constraints we scaled the focus to just be a simplistic simulation of specific foodchain\r\n",
